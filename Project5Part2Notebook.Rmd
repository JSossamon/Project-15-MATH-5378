Question 1:
A six-sided fair die is rolled. Find the probability of getting an odd number or a prime number.
```{r Question 1, echo=TRUE}
#not mutually exclusive, so P(oddORprime)=P(odd)+P(prime)-P(oddANDprime)
p_odd = 1/2
p_prime = 1/2
p_oddANDprime = 1/3
p_oddORprime = p_odd + p_prime - p_oddANDprime
cat('Probability of odd OR prime is',p_oddORprime)
```
Question 2:
In a group of 90 players, 40 are wearing blue T-shirts, 30 are wearing red T-shirts and 20 are wearing green T-shirts. Find the probability that a person picked at random is wearing a red or a green T-shirt.
```{r}
#mutually exclusive sets, so P(redORgreen)=P(red)+P(green)
p_red = 30/90
p_green = 20/90
p_redORgreen = p_red + p_green
cat('Probability of red OR green T-shirt is',p_redORgreen)
```
Question 3:

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
